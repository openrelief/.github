**Transparency in Action**  

Welcome to the GitHub home of **Open Relief**, a nonprofit platform rebuilding trust in charity through **100% transparency** and **community-driven giving**.

## **What We Do**  
We’re creating a system where:  
- Every donation is tracked in real-time.  
- Communities propose, vote, and audit how funds are spent.  
- All expenses and salaries are openly visible.

## **Why It Matters**  
Charity shouldn’t be shady. Open Relief ensures every dollar goes where it’s needed most, with no corruption or waste.
