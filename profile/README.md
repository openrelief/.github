Welcome to the GitHub home of **Open Relief**, a nonprofit platform rebuilding trust in charity through **100% transparency** and **community-driven giving**.  

### **What We Do**  
We’re creating a system where:  
- Every donation is tracked in real-time.  
- Communities propose, vote, and audit how funds are spent.  
- All expenses and salaries are openly visible.  

### **Why It Matters**  
Charity shouldn’t be shady. Open Relief ensures every donation goes where it’s needed most, eliminating corruption and waste.  

### **Get Involved**  
We’re building this in the open and need your help:
